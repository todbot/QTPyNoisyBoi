"""A helper library to setting a DACs to voltage values and reading voltage
values from ADCs.

That is, instead of setting a 16-bit integer value you can set the DAC to a
floating-point voltage value. See `VoltageOut` for more details. Same for
ADCs: instead of reading a 16-bit integer value you can read the voltage
value directly.
